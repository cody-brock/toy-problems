//Write out the code for insertion sort
//Insertion sort is good for if you're sorting data that's coming into an already sorted set.
//... and you just want to sort this one item in, as it makes a single pass.
//But it's generally not efficient and not common.

            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
        }
        arr[j+1] = currentVal;
